Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. AI is a
broad field that includes machine learning, computer vision, and natural language
processing. The goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that
would normally require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as problem-solving,
understanding language, and making decisions.
